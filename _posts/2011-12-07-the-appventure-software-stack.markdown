List the software stack, that makes up my site.
- jekyll with a set of plugins
- git, so that I can create posts from everywhere and modify everything from everywhere
- cloud9 editor, for editing and creating posts online (vim mode!)
- a daemon that imports / syncs posts from my tumblr, google+, quotevault accounts
- a rake script that is called whenever there're git updates, and renders the files to html
- and copies that over to my server
