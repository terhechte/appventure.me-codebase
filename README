# Deprecated

I've switched to a clojure based static blog engine:
https://github.com/terhechte/appventure-blog

# This is the Code that powers appventure.me #

It requires [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a blog-aware static site generator in Ruby.

The code steals heavily from other Jekyll implementations / sites I found online. 

The idea behind this was to have a blog that can be controlled in Ruby and that I can feed posts from various sources.
